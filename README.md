# Solomon Testing

Hacker News with Redux State
 
#Create a React Native app that displays 10 randomized Hacker News top stories using the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API). 

The stories must be listed in ascending order based on the stories score.

The UI must include:
    • Story title
    • Story URL
    • Story timestamp
    • Story score
    • Author id
    • Author karma score

Hint: You’ll be needing the following endpoints:
    • Top stories: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json  
    • Story item: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/${id}.json 
    • User: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/user/${id}.json 

Requirements:
    • Use latest version of React Native 
    • Application must be written in TypeScript 

Bonus Points:
    • Make sure the data is stored and fetched through a global state (It's ok to use 3rd party dependencies)
